## Task 1 : Create a simple C program and compile it using GCC followed by verification of the program output.
## Abstract : A simple C program which calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 5 is written and compiled by GCC in the following ways as given below. 

### Step 1 : Open the text editor followed by assigning the name of the C program.

This can be done by giving the following command: leafpad sum1ton.c

Here leafpad is the text editor, sum1ton is the name of the file and at last .c represents that it is a C program.

### Step 4 : Press Ctrl + S in order to save the program that has been written.

### Step 5 : Now compile the program using GCC by giving the following command : gcc sum1on.c and press enter.

# Conclusion : In the above snapshot it is verified the program is compiled successfully and the result is also correct, that is 15 (1+2+3+4+5 = 15).
